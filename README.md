# professionalPortfolio

# Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to create a professional portfolio to share with furture employers and colleagues. It allowed us to practice and build on our HTML & CSS skills. By the end, the design overall should be responsive and interactive. Nav bar links to other sections on the page should be working properly and placeholders for future applications should be set.
